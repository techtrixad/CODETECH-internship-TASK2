#Project Description
The Weather App is a web-based application that provides real-time weather updates for any city worldwide. Users can search for their desired location and instantly receive information about the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a 5-day forecast. The app is designed to be user-friendly, with a clean and responsive interface that works seamlessly across all devices.

API Integration: Integrating with a weather API to fetch real-time data was challenging due to the need for accurate and fast responses. We overcame this by optimizing API calls and caching data to improve performance.
Responsive Design: Ensuring the app looked good on both desktop and mobile required careful attention to CSS media queries and flexible grid layouts.
